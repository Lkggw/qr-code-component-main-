### What I learned
While I was doing this project I managed to learn how to create a git repository and moreover in my code i learnt how to make a shadow in an element like below.

.whitebox{
    align-items: center;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 1.25rem;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
    width: 300px;
    height: 445px;
    
    margin-left: 780px;
    margin-top: 200px;
    position: relative;
    
}

'box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);'

which i go to know after watching and learning from a video which is linked below.
